# Measuring Image Aesthetics with DL
## Overview
Neural networks(LTAT.02.001 University of Tartu) course group project repository. 

The idea here is to use neural networks to predict how aesthetically pleasing images are. Of course, this is very subjective but there is some notion of beauty that is shared by most people. This project is to explore different methods to analyse aesthetics in images using the AVA dataset (~250K images). For an example, see the paper below.
